Process Flow App functionality on feature phones Solution Overview The digital solution for UPI on feature phones is an app created by Gupshup in collaboration with Airtel Payments Bank and JioPay in collaboration with Jio Payments Bank. To execute this, solution providers must partner with feature phone manufacturers (OEM) to integrate a native payment app in the feature phone. The app's interface is similar to a smartphone app but with certain limitations due to feature phone constraints. It currently supports most UPI functionalities, including Scan and Pay from a feature phone with camera access. On-boarding Payment Journey Proximity sound based technology and voice based payments Solution Overview The proximity sound-based payment solution, allows users to make contactless UPI payments to merchants. Users call the IVR number choose Pay to Merchant, tap their phone on the merchant's device (Sound Box), press # upon hearing the unique tone, enter the payment amount and UPI PIN, and complete the transaction. The sound box confirms the transaction status, and users receive confirmation on the IVR call.
