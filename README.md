 This report presents a comprehensive analysis of a production-grade Retrieval-Augmented
 Generation (RAG) chatbot developed for JioPay customer support. The system implements
 f
 ive distinct chunking strategies, three embedding models, and three data ingestion pipelines.
 Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the performance impact of different architec
tural choices on retrieval accuracy, generation quality, and system latency. Our findings reveal
 that semantic chunking with E5 embeddings achieves optimal performance, while structural
 chunking provides the best latency-accuracy trade-off for production deployment.
